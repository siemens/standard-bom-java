# 'javadoc' branch

This branch is used to archive the generated Javadoc, so that it doesn't pollute the website folder.

The contents of the *javadoc-publish* folder will be published on the website in a folder called `javadoc`,
so, for example, we get <https://sbom.siemens.io/javadoc/v2.0.0/>.

The latest Javadoc is accessible as <https://sbom.siemens.io/javadoc/latest/>.
